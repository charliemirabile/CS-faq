# FAQ:

## What sort of computer should I get / which is best for CS majors?

Almost anything can work, a durable laptop is a nice choice. Regarding operating system, Windows MacOS, or a Linux distro all work and there are benefits to each. In Computing I and II most professors teach using Microsoft's Visual Studio which is not available on other operating systems, but can be substituted for any other IDE at with the only downside being the chance that your professor will be unable to help. Linux is extremely popular among programmers for its lightweight and customizable experience. You will learn about Linux in Computing II and can always access the Linux CS servers so having experience with Linux is good. Mac is maybe slightly friendlier to use than Linux but is very similar and so also is a good choice.
