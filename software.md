## IDEs

### [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

Visual Studio is the official IDE of Computing 1 and Computing 2.

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

VSCode is a popular free and open-source IDE developed by Microsoft. It is highly customizable for any language.

The following video shows you how to setup VSCode for your classes. The Remote Development setup will help you work on your school projects and assignments more easily.

### [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)

JetBrains offers IDE's for many different programming languages, and they are available on Windows/Mac/Linux. They are free while you're a student.

- C/C++
  - [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
- Python
  - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- Java
  - [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

### [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org)

While compiler explorer is not an IDE in the most traditional sense, it is a great tool for doodling some C/C++ code and even running it.
By default it shows the assembly instructions produced by the code, but you can drag the panes around and add more to execute the code and or see compiler warnings/output.
It supports many languages and many compilers and so you can ensure that you code compiles without errors or warnings on many systems.
The fact that it automatically compiles your code whenever you stop typing makes for extremely rapid prototyping.

## Command Line Tools

Even if these are not mentioned explicitly in your classes these tools are worth checking out:

### Text editors

#### Nano

This text editor is probably the most beginner friendly commandline editor available.
It comes pre-installed on lots of linux distributions and displays the short cuts you need to edit save find and replace etc on the bottom of the screen.
While some people do not view it as a real text editor, it is actually pretty powerful and has lots more shortcuts beyond the ones that display on the screen by default.

#### Vi / Vim

This text editor comes pre-installed on almost all linux distributions and is a favorite among power users.
It has a steep learning curve, but those who master it claim it offers unparalled speed.
If you want to learn about vim, you can run the command `vimtutor` which will walk you through the basics in an interactive way that builds upon itself

### Version Control

#### Git / Github

Version control software is critical to most software projects in the real world and git is the defacto standard.
It is almost inevitable that you will have to use it at some point in your career and the earlier your start the easier it will be.
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sjqTHE0zok) from MIT's missing semester is a nice introduction to git.
